# iNeuron Internship - Brain Tumor Segmentation & Prediction üß†üí°

I'm thrilled to announce that I've embarked on an exciting journey with iNeuron as a Deep Learning Project intern, focusing on the Brain Tumor Segmentation and Prediction project. This opportunity is a significant step in my career, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative machine learning and deep learning solutions in the realm of medical imaging and healthcare.

## Project Overview üìã

In this project, I aim to:

- Implement advanced deep learning models for precise brain tumor segmentation.
- Develop predictive models to forecast the progression of brain tumors.
- Create end-to-end pipelines for the efficient processing and analysis of medical imaging data.

## My Tech Arsenal üõ†Ô∏è

I'm equipped with a toolbox of cutting-edge technologies for this project, including:

- Deep Learning: The core of my work, enabling me to master brain tumor segmentation.
- TensorFlow and PyTorch: The pillars of my deep learning journey, facilitating model development and training.
- Unit: An invaluable deep learning library for crafting scalable and efficient models.
- SegFormers: Elevating performance through the integration of segmentation transformers.
- Moles: A critical tool for comprehensive model evaluation and fine-tuning.

## My Contributions üöÄ

Throughout the internship, I'll be actively engaged in enhancing and expanding the project. My contributions will include:

- Fine-tuning existing models and algorithms.
- Exploring and implementing novel features to boost model efficiency.
- Conducting rigorous testing and performance evaluations.
- Exploring the integration of advanced techniques and tools.
